If you’re into similar games like <emphasis level="moderate">Hitman</emphasis> or <emphasis level="moderate">Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon</emphasis>, there's a good chance you’ll find this game charmingly mission-possible. However, gamers might want to avoid <emphasis level="moderate">Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts</emphasis> if they prefer to charge in with guns blazing rather than maintaining the patient, calculating demeanor of a sniper.
