## üìñ About

The AI Game Podcast is an automated solution designed to create episodes for each game in my Steam library, providing useful insights, memorable highlights, and details about games I may have forgotten or haven't discovered yet. The episodes are rendered as audio .mp3 files and compiled into an easily accessible RSS feed, so I can listen to them wherever I prefer.

### Features:
- **Game Discovery on the Go**: Audio episodes are generated for the games in my Steam library.
- **RSS Feed Integration**: I can easily add the generated RSS feed to my favorite podcast app to stream episodes.
- **Flexible Listening**: I can enjoy the content whenever and wherever I want‚Äîon a commute, during a drive, or while on a walk.
- **Game Highlights & Insights**: Each episode covers details, game highlights, and unique aspects of a selected game.

## üéß Use Cases

- **Rediscover Forgotten Games**: Have a massive game backlog? This podcast reminds me of hidden gems I already own!
- **Effortless Game Exploration**: Too tired to research what to play next? I can listen during downtime and let the podcast help me decide.
- **On-the-Go Gaming Insights**: Stay connected with my game library even when I'm away from my desk.
- **Plan My Next Game Session**: Get inspired for my next gaming adventure while staying active or occupied.
