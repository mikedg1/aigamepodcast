## ðŸ“– About

The AI Game Podcast is an automated solution designed to create episodes for each game in my Steam library, providing useful insights, memorable highlights, and details about games I may have forgotten. The episodes are rendered as audio .mp3 files and compiled into an easily accessible RSS feed, so I can listen to them wherever I prefer.

- **RSS Feed Integration**: I can easily add the generated RSS feed to my favorite podcast app to stream episodes.
- **Flexible Listening**: I can enjoy the content whenever and wherever I wantâ€”on a commute, during a drive, or while on a walk.
- **Game Highlights & Insights**: Each episode covers details, game highlights, and unique aspects of a selected game.
