Welcome back to Pixel Pachyderms, the podcast where we explore the boundless terrains of gaming one pixel at a time. I'm your host, Ava, and today, we're charting a course through the imaginative and puzzling world of the PC game, <emphasis level="moderate">Make Way</emphasis>.

So, what is <emphasis level="moderate">Make Way</emphasis> all about? At its core, this game fits into the puzzle-arcade genre. It's a refreshing blend of strategy and reflex-based play, where your primary goal is to pave paths, manage resources, and keep the flow smooth.

Each level is crafted with increasing difficulty, demanding players to employ both precision and creativity.
